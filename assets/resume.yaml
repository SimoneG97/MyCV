          Software engineer with experience in backend development
        description: >
          I have a good background in building backend applications, especially focusing on performance optimizations.

          Throughout the projects I've worked on, I've have used specialized technologies, like OPC-UA for IoT, ANTLR for developing a DSL and OR-Tools for IP/LP problems. 

          I have used Python and Java for big projects, but have also used Scala and C# on smaller side projects.
          I also used Rust for personal small projects and would love to try programming with it for work.
