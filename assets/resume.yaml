          Software engineer with experience in backend development
        description: >
          I have a good background in building backend applications, especially focusing on performance optimizations.
          All projects I've worked were setup to be Docker-friendly. \

          Throughout the projects I've worked on, I've have used specialized technologies, like OPC-UA for IIoT, ANTLR
          to designing a DSL and OR-Tools for IP/LP problems. \

          I have used Python and Java for big projects, Scala and C\# on smaller side-projects and Rust
          for personal projects and would love to try programming with it for work.

            Developed RESTful APIs and integrated third-party services like Camunda 7, while
            also designing a DSL to integrate in Camunda forms to inject validation / assertions
            and integrating validation in the already existing APIs.
          - >-
            Worked on setting up a Linux machine to have an internal development / testing environment
            which isn't local, to also check difficult-to-setup behaviours.
            (e.g. Reverse Proxy, SSL, Docker Compose with mounts over storage, etc..)
          - >-
            Created a Jenkins pipeline which builds a Docker image that contains a project, extracts
            it's build and makes scan through Mend CLI

            Developed a MSSQL DB comparator with a "diff"-able report.

            Enhanced / bug fixing on already existing projects.
          - >-
            Developed IP/LP model and solver which enabled/disables contraints based on user preferences.
          - >-
            Developed CP model and solver which solves small problem instance with also block zones constraints.
